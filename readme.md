# Ports of Call addon collection

Welcome to my collection of addons for [Ports Of Call](www.portsofcall.de/)
(PoC). It includes also original object that have been redrawn. I am not the author
of any file here: I am organizing other's work, taken from the internet, so that
there are no duplicates nor errors like duplicate names, malformed XML files and so on.

The original idea of a PoC addon collection is [Bernd Gabriel's](https://github.com/BerndGabriel/poc-user_addons);
this project is a fork of Bernd's one.

Currently the following addons are available:

|  | Total | Redrawn | New |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Goods | 83 | 0 | 83 |
| Harbours | 145 | 0 | 145 |
| Ships | 549 | 49 | 500 |


The sources of my collection are:

* The original PoC objects.
* Verfy few addons in the original distribution.
* Stickymonk's addons, which are no longer available; I downloaded Stickymonk's files a few years ago and I am currently using my personal copy.
* [Zootier's PoC Shipyard](http://www.zootierspocshipyard.de.vu/).
* A few BigBear goods that I added as a test (more objects from [BigBear's site](http://poc.bigbear.de/)) coming in the future.


Of course, if anyone does not
like having his/her files here I will remove them promptly. Just send me a PM in
[PoC forum](http://www.rdkleinforum.de) (you have to be registered in order to do so).

I hope you enjoy my work and .... happy shipping!
