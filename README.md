Ports of Call addon collection
==============================

This project hosts Ports Of Call (PoC) user addon files, for ships, ports and goods.

It is a fork of `Bernd Gabriel's one <https://github.com/BerndGabriel/poc-user_addons>`_ .
Purpose of having a fork is first of all to clean up the files, trace the authors and
put together all files found around on the internet.

Bernd let us know of his project in a `PoC's forum topic <http://www.rdkleinforum.de/viewtopic.php?p=29504#29504>`_
in which I had pointed out to take care about publishing other people's work.
However, in more than a year, no one has complained about the publication. In
the hope of improving what the available files, I am now doing this work.

Of course, Bernd's invitation is valid also here: if someone does not like to
see his/her work published here, I will remove it promptly.

Also, if someone wants to have his work here, he/she can contact me via PM on
PoC' s forum.

I hope you enjoy my work and .... happy shipping!
