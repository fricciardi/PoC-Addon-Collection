# Ports of Call addon collection

Welcome to my collection of addons for [Ports Of Call](www.portsofcall.de/)
(PoC). It includes also original object that have been redrawn. I am not the author
of any file here: I am organizing other's work, taken from the internet, so that
there are no duplicates nor clear errors.

The original idea is [Bernd Gabriel's](https://github.com/BerndGabriel/poc-user_addons);
this project is a fork ofBernd's one.

One of the main purpose of this project is to trace the author of each object, which
I solved adding an additional element in PoC's XML files. Of course, if anyone does not
like having his/her files here I will remove them promptly. Just send me a PM in
[PoC forum](http://www.rdkleinforum.de) (You have to be registered in order to do so).



I hope you enjoy my work and .... happy shipping!
