# Ports of Call addon collection

Welcome to my collection of addons for [Ports Of Call](www.portsofcall.de/)
(PoC). It includes also original object that have been redrawn. I am not the author
of any file here: I am organizing other's work, taken from the internet, so that
there are no duplicates nor errors like duplicate names, malformed XML files and so on.

The original idea of a PoC addon collection is [Bernd Gabriel's](https://github.com/BerndGabriel/poc-user_addons);
this project is a fork of Bernd's one.

Currently the following addons are available:

  | New | Redrawn
    ---|:--:|:--:
    Goods | 78 | 1
    Ports | 143 | 1
    Ships | 1084 | 99
    

One of the main purpose of this project is to trace the author of each object, which
I solved adding an additional element in PoC's XML files. Of course, if anyone does not
like having his/her files here I will remove them promptly. Just send me a PM in
[PoC forum](http://www.rdkleinforum.de) (you have to be registered in order to do so).

The main sources of my collection are:

* [Zootier's PoC Shipyard](http://www.zootierspocshipyard.de.vu/).
* Stickymonk's addons, which are no longer available; I downloaded Stickymonk's files a few years ago and I am
  currently using my personal copy.

I hope you enjoy my work and .... happy shipping!
